### 2. **Pull Request Template**
When you want to propose a change (code, documentation, or otherwise):

- **Start a Pull Request (PR)** using the provided template.
- **Fill out every section**:
  - **Description**: Clearly explain what your PR does.
  - **Type of Change**: Select the type(s) that best describe your PR.
  - **Related Issue**: Link to any relevant issues.
  - **Changes Made**: List the main changes.
  - **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes. Use the provided pipenv commands for running tests.
  - **Performance & Security**: Note any impact or improvements.
  - **Documentation**: Indicate if you updated docs.
  - **Code Quality**: Run formatting, linting, type checks, and security scans as listed.
- **Check off items** only if you have actually completed them.
- If a section doesn’t apply, write “N/A” or explain why.
- **Be thorough and honest**—this helps reviewers understand and accept your contribution faster.

### 3. **Feature Request Template**
When you want to suggest a new feature:

- Use the feature request template to structure your idea.
- **Describe the problem** you want to solve and your proposed solution.
- Include any alternative solutions you’ve considered.
- List specific use cases and, if relevant, propose an API design.
- Fill out sections on performance, compatibility, testing, and documentation needs.
- Set a priority and desired timeline if you have one.
- Add clear acceptance criteria so it’s easy to know when the feature is “done.”

### 4. **General Guidance for All Contributions**
- **Use “Simplicity” or “Simplicity Indexer”** in all references and documentation.
- **Follow the documented workflow**: use pipenv for development, but you can use requirements.txt as a fallback if needed.
- **Keep all links and references up-to-date** in your contributions.
- **Be clear, specific, and complete** in all your submissions—this helps everyone understand and use your work.
- **If using an agentic/AI tool** to generate your PR or issue, review the output to ensure it follows these guidelines and is accurate for this project.

**Summary:**  
Whenever you want to push something or propose a PR, use the provided templates, fill out all sections honestly and completely, follow the Simplicity Indexer’s naming and workflow standards, and always communicate respectfully.

If you follow these steps, your contributions will fit smoothly into the project!
